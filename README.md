# app-rating-calc
A simple web app that allows you to calculate how many new positive ratings you would need to push current app average rating above a certain value.

## Features
- Mobile friendly UI
- Dark mode
- Manually add rating number either with keyboard or by tapping + - buttons
- Ratings are encoded in the url, so once you set the values up, you can share or bookmark the url so you don't have to type them in again.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
